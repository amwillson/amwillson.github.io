title: "Climate and hydraulic traits interact to set thresholds for liana viability"

excerpt: 'Tropical trees and lianas are functionally differentiated by hydraulic traits, particularly the rate of water conductivity through the xylem. The difference in hydraulic traits explains difference in GPP at the individual plant level. Despite observations that lianas are most prevalent under drier hydroclimatic conditions at present, we show that liana GPP is more sensitive to projected drying hydroclimate in the future as a result of more acquisitive and vulnerable hydraulic functional traits.'

Lianas, or woody vines, and trees dominate the canopy of tropical forests and comprise the majority of tropical aboveground carbon storage. These growth forms respond differently to contemporary variation in climate and resource availability, but their responses to future climate change are poorly understood because there are very few predictive ecosystem models representing lianas. We compile a database of liana functional traits (846 species) and use it to parameterize a mechanistic model of liana-tree competition. The substantial difference between liana and tree hydraulic conductivity represents a critical source of inter-growth form variation. Here, we show that lianas are many times more sensitive to drying atmospheric conditions than trees as a result of this trait difference. Further, we use our competition model and projections of tropical hydroclimate based on Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5 to show that lianas are more susceptible to reaching a hydraulic threshold for viability by 2100.
