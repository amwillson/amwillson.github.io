    <p>Ecological forecasting is an emerging field that integrates environmental science, statistics, decision science, and climate science with the goal of making quantitative, decision-relevant predictions by combining models and data (<a href="https://amwillson.github.io/publication/woelmer-etal-2021">Woelmer <i>et al.</i> 2021</a>). I have been involved in a number of publications laying the foundation of the discipline (<a href="https://amwillson.github.io/publication/dietze-etal-2024">Dietze<i>et al.</i> 2024</a>), including establishing a unifying forecasting lexicon (<a href="https://amwillson.github.io/publications/">Sjodin <i>et al.</i> in review</a>). I also contributed to the development of the NEON Ecological Forecasting Challenge, a platform for scientists to make comparable ecological forecasts, inspired by data science challenges (<a href="https://amwillson.github.io/publication/thomas-etal-2023">Thomas <i>et al.</i> 2023</a>).</p>
    <p>A compelling aspect of ecological forecasting for me is the opportunity to collaborate widely. For instance, I recently collaborated with aquatic ecologists to produce a long-term forecast of Alaskan wetland temperatures. We found that Alaskan wetlands are at high risk for crossing a temperature threshold for salmon viability, with implications for managing wild populations of these culturally and economically important species (<a href="https://amwillson.github.io/publications/">Adey <i>et al.</i> in press</a>). <b>I am eager to contribute my ecological forecasting expertise to new contexts and I'm always looking for new collaborations! If you're interested in developing a project together, please contact me!</b></p>
