I have been involved in a number of publications laying the foundation of the discipline (Dietze <i>et al.</i> 2024), including establishing a unifying forecasting lexicon (Sjodin <i>et al.</i> in review). I also contributed to the development of the NEON Ecological Forecasting Challenge, a platform for scientists to make comparable ecological forecasts, inspired by data science challenges (Thomas <i>et al.</i> 2023). Framing my science in terms of ecological forecasting allows me to simultaneously advance basic research on environmental change while making predictions that can inform policy and management of terrestrial ecosystems.

A compelling aspect of ecological forecasting for me is the opportunity to collaborate widely. For instance, I recently collaborated with aquatic ecologists to produce a long-term forecast of Alaskan wetland temperatures. We found that Alaskan wetlands are at high risk for crossing a temperature threshold for salmon viability, with implications for managing wild populations of these culturally and economically important species (Adey <i>et al.</i> in press). **I am eager to contribute my ecological forecasting expertise to new contexts and I'm always looking for new collaborations!
