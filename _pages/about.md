**Hello! I am currently a PhD candidate in the  [McLachlan Lab](https://sites.nd.edu/paleolab/) at the University of Notre Dame, where I study long-term controls on terrestrial carbon cycling.**

I am a member of the [PalEON Project](http://paleonproject.org), where I have focused on using historical and paleoecological proxy data sources to quantify the relationship between environmental variables and vegetation at large spatial scales (Midwest, US region) and over long temporal scales (thousands of years).

I also participate in the [Ecological Forecasting Initiative](http://paleonproject.org), where I have co-led the Ecological Forecasting Initiative Student Association, and led a manuscript within the Education Working Group to understand where gaps and opportunities exist in teaching ecological forecasting at undergraduate and graduate levels.
