## Quantitative forest ecology and biogeochemical cycling

Hello! I am currently a PhD candidate in the  [McLachlan Lab](https://sites.nd.edu/paleolab/) at the University of Notre Dame, where I study long-term controls on terrestrial carbon cycling.

Broadly, I am interested in improving predictability of terrestrial carbon cycling by understanding both short-term and long-term controls on carbon. I am also passionate about broadening participation in quantitative sciences via undergraduate education.
