*Rosa multiflora* (multiflora rose) is a non-native shrub that has invaded many North American natural areas, resulting in negative impacts on native flora and fauna. In order to prevent further spread of *R. multiflora*, it is important to understand the abiotic habitat associations that characterize *R. multiflora* prevalence. Here, we examine how distance from the nearest trail, soil moisture, soil pH, relative sunlight availability, and dominant overstory composition are associated with *R. multiflora* presence and abundance at a preserve in southwest Michigan. We found that *R. multiflora* presence is associated with high sunlight availability and Red Maple-dominated forests. Additionally, *R. multiflora* abundance is associated with low soil moisture and Black Oak-dominated forests. The purpose of this research was to inform land management in determining the uninvaded forests that are most susceptible to *R. multiflora* invasion. Based on our results, we recommend that land managers focus on areas of high light availability (along forest edges and within open canopy areas) and low soil moisture in an effort to curtail *R. multiflora* invasion.
