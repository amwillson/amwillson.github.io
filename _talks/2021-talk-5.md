Ecological forecasters, as participants in a quantitatively advanced field, have a responsibility to actively work towards diversifying participation. As participants in an emerging field, we at the Ecological Forecasting Initiative have the unique opportunity to establish a culture of inclusivity as the discipline grows. Our ultimate goal is to improve equity in the access to and quality of ecological forecasting education. We detail progress on our current initiatives, including collaborations with students and faculty at minority serving institutions to identify areas where current educational resources do not meet student needs, and leveraging the NEON Forecasting Challenge to develop forecasting curricula.
